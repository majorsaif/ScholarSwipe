## ü§ñ Perplexity AI Integration

ScholarSwipe uses the **Perplexity Sonar API** to fetch relevant research papers based on the user‚Äôs query. The **Sonar-Pro LLM** is then used to generate structured summaries for each paper, including:

- Key findings  
- Methodology  
- Limitations  
- Relevance score  
- Authenticity score  

The backend exposes endpoints that return these summaries in JSON format, which the frontend then presents as swipeable cards.
